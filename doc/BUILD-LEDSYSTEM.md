# LED System Build Instructions
The LEDs used are **addressable LED** stripes. 
There are many type of them (i.e. ws281x, ws2801, apa102). 
The original project goes for WS2801, but they were not available in Q4 2020 for me. 
Therefore this project uses WS2811 LEDs.

## General Considerations
Bear in mind that 198 LEDs wired with 3-4 cables each mean a lot of soldering work. You probably want to order ready-to-use LED strips with a 
suitable custom length. 5V leads to higher currents compared to 12V versions of comparable bright LEDs. The voltage drop in such a length will lead
to color mismatches. To fix this the strips usually have separate voltage connectors on each end in addition to the 3 / 4 pin connection. 

## Wiring the LED stripes
The WS2811 LED strips have three wires (colors may differ in your case): 
- White = GND
- Red = 5V
- Green = Signal
