BOK Notes:

Needed to run ./install.sh to get the BLE daemon up and running at machine restart/via dbus. I think it was the symlink step I missed manually.


However, this f****** up the sound, which I actually want. They disable sound due to their led driver.


# Check moonboard BLE status
$ systemctl status com.moonboard.service

# I've disabled this with ' systemctl disable moonboard.service'
# systemctl status moonboard.service
